Analyze Inbox UI and Chat Page Bug
Hello! The /inbox page is now successfully fetching conversations, but we have two new issues: the UI does not match the Figma design, and clicking a conversation leads to a black screen.

Your task is to perform a read-only analysis of the frontend code to diagnose the root cause of both problems. Do not edit any files.

1. Inbox UI Mismatch Analysis
File Location: Analyze the client/src/pages/InboxPage.tsx and its primary child component, client/src/components/inbox/ConversationListItem.tsx.

Styling & Structure: Compare the JSX structure and Tailwind CSS classes used in these files against the visual requirements from the Figma screenshots.

Data Mapping: Verify that all necessary data fields from the Conversation object (e.g., unreadCount, lastMessage.timestamp, participant details for group chats) are being correctly passed as props and rendered in the ConversationListItem component.

Report On: Why does the current UI deviate from the Figma design? Is it a styling issue (incorrect Tailwind classes), a structural issue (wrong JSX), or a data issue (not all required data is being displayed)?

2. Chat Page "Black Screen" Bug Analysis
Routing: Check the <Link> component in ConversationListItem.tsx. Does it correctly navigate to the conversation-centric URL format: /chat/conversation/:conversationId?

File Location: Identify the React component that is supposed to render at this route (e.g., client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx).

Data Fetching: How does this chat page component fetch the messages for a specific conversation? It should be extracting the conversationId from the URL and using it to call an API endpoint like GET /api/messages/:conversationId. Verify this logic.

Rendering Logic: Analyze the component's render method. A black screen is often caused by:

An uncaught JavaScript error.

An unhandled error from the data-fetching hook (useQuery).

The component returning null or undefined before data is ready, without a proper loading state.

Final Report:

Based on your analysis, provide a single report that explains the root cause of both the UI mismatch and the black screen bug. Pinpoint the specific files and logic that need to be fixed.
