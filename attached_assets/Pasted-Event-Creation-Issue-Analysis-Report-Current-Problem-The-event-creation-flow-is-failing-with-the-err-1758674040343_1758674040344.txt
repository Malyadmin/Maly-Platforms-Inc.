Event Creation Issue Analysis Report
Current Problem
The event creation flow is failing with the error "Please log in to create an event" despite the user being properly authenticated. No POST request to /api/events is reaching the server, indicating the issue is in the frontend code.

Root Cause Analysis
1. Authentication Mismatch
Server Side: User "end" (ID: 232) is properly authenticated via Passport session
Frontend Side: The event creation code relies on localStorage items (maly_session_id and maly_user_id) for authentication
Problem: These localStorage items may not be present even when the user is authenticated via Passport session
2. Frontend Authentication Check Logic
The handleSubmitEvent function checks:

const sessionId = localStorage.getItem('maly_session_id');
const userId = localStorage.getItem('maly_user_id');
if (!sessionId || !userId) {
  // Shows "Please log in to create an event" error
  return;
}
3. Evidence from Server Logs
User is successfully authenticated for other API calls (/api/events GET, /api/users/browse, etc.)
Server logs show successful session deserialization: "Deserialized user found: end"
Missing: No POST request to /api/events in server logs
4. Possible Causes
Primary Issue: localStorage Authentication Data Missing

The frontend expects maly_session_id and maly_user_id in localStorage
These may not be set during the current authentication flow
Other parts of the app work because they use different authentication methods (Passport session, cookies)
Secondary Issues:

JavaScript error preventing function execution
Form submission not triggering the correct handler
Network request being blocked before reaching server
Required Investigation Steps
Check Browser Console: Look for JavaScript errors when clicking "Create Event"
Check localStorage: Verify if maly_session_id and maly_user_id exist in browser localStorage
Check Network Tab: See if any network request is attempted when submitting
Compare with Working Flows: Check how other authenticated endpoints handle authentication
Recommended Solution Approach
The fix likely involves either:

Ensuring localStorage is populated during login/authentication
Modifying the event creation to use session-based auth like other working endpoints
Adding fallback authentication methods (checking session state if localStorage is missing)
Current Status
Backend authentication middleware has been fixed (isAuthenticated vs requireAuth)
Frontend has detailed logging added for debugging
Server is ready to receive requests
Issue is in frontend authentication check preventing request from being sent
