Excellent. The analysis is definitive and the path forward is clear. This is a perfect example of how a "lay of the land" analysis can save hours of debugging. The agent has proven that Drizzle expects `camelCase` and handles the conversion automatically.

Here is the final build prompt to fix this issue once and for all.

### **Build Prompt: Revert to camelCase for Drizzle ORM**

Hello\! Your analysis has definitively confirmed that the Drizzle ORM automatically handles the conversion from JavaScript `camelCase` properties to database `snake_case` columns. Our previous fix interfered with this process.

Your task is to revert the property names in the `tiersToInsert` object back to `camelCase` to align with Drizzle's expected input.

**1. File to Edit:**

  * Open `server/routes.ts`.

**2. Locate the `tiersToInsert` Mapping:**

  * Find the `.map()` function that creates the `tiersToInsert` array.

**3. Revert the Property Names to `camelCase`:**

  * Modify the object being created in the map. You must change the JavaScript property keys from `snake_case` **back to `camelCase`** to match all the other working examples in the codebase.

    ```typescript
    // Change this incorrect mapping:
    const tiersToInsert = ticketTiers.map(tier => ({
      event_id: eventId,
      stripe_product_id: ...,
      stripe_price_id: ...,
      is_active: ...,
      created_at: ...,
      // ...other properties
    }));

    // To this CORRECT mapping:
    const tiersToInsert = ticketTiers.map(tier => ({
      eventId: eventId,
      stripeProductId: ...,
      stripePriceId: ...,
      isActive: ...,
      createdAt: ...,
      // ...other properties that are camelCase in your JS
    }));
    ```

**4. Validate the Fix:**

  * After making the change, restart the server and attempt to create an event with ticket tiers.
  * **Expected Result:** The event and all of its associated ticket tiers will be created successfully in the database with **no `TypeError`** in the logs.
