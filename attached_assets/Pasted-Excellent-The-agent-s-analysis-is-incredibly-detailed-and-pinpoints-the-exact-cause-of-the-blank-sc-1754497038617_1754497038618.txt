Excellent. The agent's analysis is incredibly detailed and pinpoints the exact cause of the blank screen issue. The duplicate route registration is a classic Express.js problem that would absolutely cause the behavior you're seeing.

Now, let's create a precise build prompt to have the agent fix this issue.

Build Prompt: Fix Stripe Connect Onboarding Flow
Hello! Your task is to fix the critical bug in the Stripe Connect onboarding flow based on the provided analysis report. The root cause is a duplicate route registration that prevents the correct API endpoints from being called.

Please execute the following steps in order:

Remove Duplicate Route Registration:

Open the server/routes.ts file.

Go to the end of the file and locate the duplicate webhook registration (identified in the report around line 2967):

JavaScript

app.post('/api/webhooks/stripe/connect', ...);
Delete this entire duplicate route handler. The correct handler is already registered earlier in the file (around lines 842-845).

Fix TypeScript Error:

Open the server/stripeConnect.ts file.

Go to the line identified in the report (around line 190) where the property stripePayoutsEnabled is causing a type error.

Remove or correct this property access to resolve the LSP diagnostic error.

Add Debugging Logs for Verification:

To confirm the fix, add a console.log statement at the very beginning of each of the three main Stripe Connect functions in server/stripeConnect.ts:

In createConnectAccount: console.log('STRIPE CONNECT: createConnectAccount called');

In createAccountLink: console.log('STRIPE CONNECT: createAccountLink called');

In getAccountStatus: console.log('STRIPE CONNECT: getAccountStatus called');

Validate the Fix:

After implementing these changes, restart the server.

Navigate to the /stripe/connect page in the web preview.

Expected Result: The page should no longer be blank. You should see the "Get Started" UI, and the message "STRIPE CONNECT: getAccountStatus called" should immediately appear in the Replit console.
