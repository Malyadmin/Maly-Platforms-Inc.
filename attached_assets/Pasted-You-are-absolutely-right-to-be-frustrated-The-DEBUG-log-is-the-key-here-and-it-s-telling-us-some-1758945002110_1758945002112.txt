You are absolutely right to be frustrated. The `DEBUG` log is the key here, and it's telling us something very subtle and important. This is a fantastic step in the right direction because we've moved the error from your application logic to a very specific data mapping issue.

Let's break it down:
1.  **Your Code is Correct:** The `DEBUG` log proves that your application logic is now working perfectly. It creates a clean array of tier objects, and each object clearly has the correct `eventId: 177`.
2.  **The Error is in Drizzle:** The error is happening *inside* the Drizzle ORM library (`.../drizzle-orm/pg-core/query-builders/insert.js`).

This combination means the data you are *sending* to Drizzle is not in the exact format Drizzle *expects* based on your database schema. The most common cause for this is a **naming convention mismatch**.

Your JavaScript code uses **camelCase** (e.g., `eventId`, `stripeProductId`).
Your database schema likely uses **snake_case** (e.g., `event_id`, `stripe_product_id`).

When Drizzle tries to map your `tiersToInsert` object to the database columns, it looks for a property named `event_id`, doesn't find it (because yours is named `eventId`), gets `undefined`, and then crashes.

Let's confirm this with a new "lay of the land" prompt.

### **Build Prompt: Analyze Drizzle Schema vs. JavaScript Object Mismatch**

Hello! We have successfully debugged the application logic for ticket tier creation, but the database insertion is still failing inside the Drizzle ORM. The `DEBUG` log confirms the data being sent is correct, so the issue must be a mismatch between the JavaScript object and the database schema.

Your task is to perform a **read-only analysis** to compare these two structures and pinpoint the exact discrepancy. **Do not edit any files.**

Please investigate the following:

**1. Analyze the JavaScript Object Structure:**
* Open `server/routes.ts` and find the `POST /api/events` endpoint.
* Locate the code where the `tiersToInsert` array is created.
* Report the exact property names used in the objects within this array (e.g., `eventId`, `stripeProductId`, `createdAt`). Pay close attention to the **casing (camelCase)**.

**2. Analyze the Drizzle Database Schema:**
* Open `db/schema.ts`.
* Find the definition for the `ticketTiers` table.
* Report the exact column names defined in the schema. Pay close attention to the **casing (snake_case)** (e.g., `event_id`, `stripe_product_id`, `created_at`).

**Final Report:**

Based on your analysis, provide a report that presents a side-by-side comparison of the JavaScript property names and the Drizzle schema column names. Confirm if there is a camelCase vs. snake_case mismatch, as this is the direct cause of the `TypeError`.
