Analyze Connection Data Mapping in Inbox
Hello! We have a critical data mapping issue on the /inbox page. The "My Connections" and "Pending Requests" sections are displaying incorrect information, even though the same backend API provides the correct data to the working iOS (Xcode) build.

Your task is to perform a read-only analysis of the web frontend code to find the root cause of this discrepancy. Do not edit any files.

Please investigate the following areas:

1. Data Fetching Analysis (InboxPage.tsx):

Open the client/src/pages/InboxPage.tsx file.

Identify the exact API endpoints and parameters being called to fetch data for "My Connections" and "Pending Requests". This is likely one or more calls to endpoints like GET /api/connections.

Verify the parameters being sent. For example, is the frontend correctly sending ?status=accepted for connections and ?status=pending for requests?

2. Frontend Filtering and Rendering Logic:

Examine how the component processes the data returned from the API.

After the data is fetched, is there any client-side filtering logic being applied?

How is the data for each section being passed to its respective UI component?

3. Crucial Comparison with Swift Implementation:

Reference the Swift code for the iOS inbox.

Compare the API calls: Does the React frontend call the exact same endpoints with the exact same parameters as the working Swift implementation?

Compare the client-side logic: How does the Swift code filter or process the returned data to separate "pending" from "accepted" connections? Is the React component missing a similar crucial filtering step?

Final Report:

Based on your comparative analysis, provide a report that pinpoints the specific discrepancy between the React and Swift implementations. Your report should clearly state whether the issue is:

A) An incorrect API call (e.g., the React app is calling the wrong endpoint or using the wrong parameters).

B) Flawed client-side logic (e.g., the React app is not correctly filtering or mapping the data after it's been fetched).

Pinpoint the exact files and lines of code that need to be fixed.
