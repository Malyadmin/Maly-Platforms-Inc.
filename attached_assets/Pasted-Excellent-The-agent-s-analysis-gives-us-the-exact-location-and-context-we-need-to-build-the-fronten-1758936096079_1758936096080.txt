Excellent. The agent's analysis gives us the exact location and context we need to build the frontend UI for tiered ticketing. We'll replace the simple price input with a dynamic form section.

Here is the complete build prompt for your Replit agent.

### **Build Prompt: Implement Frontend UI for Tiered Ticketing**

Hello! Your task is to implement the frontend UI for the new tiered ticketing system within the event creation flow. You will replace the existing single price input with a dynamic interface for adding and managing multiple ticket tiers, using `react-hook-form`.

Please execute the following phases in order.

### **Phase 1: Update State and Validation Schema**

First, update the data structures to support an array of tiers.

1.  **Update Form State Type:**
    * Locate the `EventCreationData` type definition.
    * Remove the `price: string` property and replace it with `ticketTiers: TicketTier[]`, where `TicketTier` is an object containing `name`, `description`, `price`, and `quantity`.

2.  **Update Validation Schema:**
    * Open the `shared/eventCreation.ts` file.
    * Modify the `step5Schema` (Zod schema).
    * Remove the validation for the single `price` field.
    * Add new validation logic for the `ticketTiers` array. It should ensure that if `isPaidEvent` is true, the array contains at least one tier, and each tier object has a valid `name` and `price`.

### **Phase 2: Build the Dynamic Tiered Ticketing UI**

Next, build the new user interface using `react-hook-form`'s capabilities for dynamic fields.

1.  **Implement `useFieldArray`:**
    * Open `client/src/pages/CreateEventFlowPage.tsx` and find the `Step5PricingAudience` component.
    * Inside the component, initialize `react-hook-form`'s `useFieldArray` hook to manage the `ticketTiers` state. This will provide `fields`, `append`, and `remove` functions.

2.  **Replace the Old Price Input:**
    * Locate and **delete the entire `div` that contains the single `<Input>` for the event price.**
    * In its place, add the new dynamic UI:
        * Map over the `fields` array provided by `useFieldArray`.
        * For each item, render a set of `<Input>` fields for the tier's **Name**, **Description**, **Price**, and **Quantity**. Each input must be correctly registered with `react-hook-form` (e.g., `register(\`ticketTiers.${index}.name\`)`).
        * Include a "Remove" button next to each tier that calls the `remove(index)` function from `useFieldArray`.
        * Below the list of tiers, add an **"Add Tier"** button. Its `onClick` handler should call the `append()` function from `useFieldArray` with a default new tier object (e.g., `{ name: '', price: '', ... }`).

### **Phase 3: Validate the Implementation**

After implementing the changes, test the event creation flow.

* **Expected Result:**
    1.  In the "Pricing & Audience" step, the old single price input is gone.
    2.  When the "Paid Event" switch is toggled on, the new tiered ticketing interface appears.
    3.  You can successfully add multiple ticket tiers, fill in their details, and remove them.
    4.  The form submission correctly passes the array of `ticketTiers` to the next step.
