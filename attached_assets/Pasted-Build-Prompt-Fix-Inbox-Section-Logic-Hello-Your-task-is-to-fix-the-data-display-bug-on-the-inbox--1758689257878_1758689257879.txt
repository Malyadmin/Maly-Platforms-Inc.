Build Prompt: Fix Inbox Section Logic
Hello! Your task is to fix the data display bug on the /inbox page where users appear in both the "My Connections" and "Messages & Groups" sections. The analysis confirms the backend is working as intended, so the fix must be implemented on the frontend.

Please execute the following steps:

1. Open and Analyze the Frontend Component:

Open the client/src/pages/InboxPage.tsx file.

Locate the data fetching logic where you get the conversations list from the GET /api/conversations endpoint. This list will be the single source of truth for both sections.

2. Implement Correct Filtering Logic:

Before the return statement in your component, create two new filtered arrays from the main conversations list:

For "Messages & Groups": Create a new array named conversationsWithMessages that contains only the items from the original conversations list where conversation.lastMessage is not null.

For "My Connections": Create a new array named connectionsWithoutMessages that contains only the items from the original conversations list where conversation.lastMessage is null.

3. Update the Rendering Logic (JSX):

Find the JSX for the "Messages & Groups" section. Modify it to map over your new conversationsWithMessages array.

Find the JSX for the "My Connections" section. Modify it to map over your new connectionsWithoutMessages array. For these items, you will display the details from the conversation.otherParticipant object.

4. (Optional) Optimize API Calls:

Since the conversations list now provides all the necessary information, the separate API call to GET /api/connections within this component is likely no longer needed. You can remove this useQuery hook to improve page performance.

5. Validate the Fix:

After implementing the changes, test the /inbox page.

Expected Result: Connections with message history should appear ONLY in "Messages & Groups." Connections with NO message history should appear ONLY in "My Connections." No user should ever appear in both sections simultaneously.
