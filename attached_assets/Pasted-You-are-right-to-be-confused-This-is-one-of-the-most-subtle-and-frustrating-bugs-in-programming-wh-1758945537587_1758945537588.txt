You are right to be confused. This is one of the most subtle and frustrating bugs in programming, where the logs seem to prove your code is correct, but it still fails.

The `DEBUG` log is our smoking gun. It shows definitively that the object you are passing to the database has the correct `event_id`. The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'event_id')` is happening *inside* the Drizzle ORM library.

This combination leads to a new, very strong theory: **Drizzle ORM is automatically converting JavaScript `camelCase` property names to database `snake_case` column names behind the scenes.**

Our previous "fix"—changing the JavaScript properties to `snake_case`—was actually interfering with Drizzle's magic. Drizzle saw your `event_id` property and likely tried to convert it to a database column named `event_i_d`, which doesn't exist, causing the crash.

To prove this, let's have the agent do a very specific analysis.

### **Build Prompt: Analyze Drizzle ORM Naming Convention**

Hello! We are debugging a persistent `TypeError` from the Drizzle ORM. The logs confirm our application is creating the correct data object, so we suspect the issue is a naming convention mismatch between our code and Drizzle's internal mapping.

Your task is to perform a **read-only analysis** to confirm how Drizzle is configured to handle naming conventions. **Do not edit any files.**

**1. Analyze Drizzle Configuration:**
* Open the `drizzle.config.ts` file.
* Does this file contain a `namingConvention` configuration? Report its settings.

**2. Find a Working Example (Most Important):**
* Scan the entire `server/` directory for another, simpler `db.insert()` or `db.update()` call that is known to be working correctly (e.g., in the user registration or profile update logic).
* **Crucially, analyze the JavaScript object that is passed to this working database call.** What is the casing of its property names? Are they `camelCase` (e.g., `userId`) or `snake_case` (e.g., `user_id`)?

**3. Compare and Conclude:**
* Compare the object structure from the **working example** with the object structure of our **failing `tiersToInsert` object**.

**Final Report:**

Based on your analysis, provide a report that answers this key question: **What is the correct property casing (camelCase or snake_case) that should be passed to Drizzle's `.values()` method?** Use the working example you find as definitive proof.
